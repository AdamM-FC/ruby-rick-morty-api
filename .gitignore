# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
rails/.bundle

# Ignore the default postgres database.
rails/db/*.postgresql

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
rails/log/*
rails/tmp/*
rails/log/.keep
rails/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
rails/tmp/pids/*
rails/tmp/pids/
rails/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
rails/storage/*
rails/storage/.keep
rails/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
rails/config/master.key
